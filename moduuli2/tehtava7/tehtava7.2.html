    <h1>Tehtävänanto: Modify the function above so that it gets the number
      of sides on the dice as a parameter. With the modified function you
      can for example roll a 21-sided role-playing dice.
      The difference to the last exercise is that the dice rolling
      in the main program continues until the program gets the maximum
      number on the dice, which is asked from the user at the beginning. (2p)</h1>
