    <h1>Tehtävänanto: In the Harry Potter children's books,
        the sorting hat assigns a new student at Hogwarts School
        of Witchcraft and Wizardry to one of the four classes,
        which are Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff,
        and Ravenclaw. Write an electronic sorting hat that
        asks for a student's name and draws a room for him.
        If you enter Anna as the name, for example,
        the program prints to the HTML document "Anna, you are Ravenclaw."
